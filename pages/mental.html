            <h2>Mental Fitness in COVID-19 Pandemic</h2>
            <img src="../assets/brain.png" alt="">
            <p>As countries introduce measures to restrict movement as part of efforts to reduce the number of people
                infected with COVID-19, more and more of us are making huge changes to our daily routines.</p>

            <p> The new realities of working from home, temporary unemployment, home-schooling of children, and lack of
                physical contact with other family members, friends and colleagues take time to get used to. Adapting to
                lifestyle changes such as these, and managing the fear of contracting the virus and worry about people
                close to us who are particularly vulnerable, are challenging for all of us. They can be particularly
                difficult for people with mental health conditions.

                Fortunately, there are lots of things that we can do to look after our own mental health and to help
                others who may need some extra support and care.</p>

            <p> Here are tips and advice that we hope you will find useful.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Get up and go to bed at similar times every day.</li>
                <li>Keep up with personal hygiene.</li>
                <li>Eat healthy meals at regular times.</li>
                <li>Exercise regularly.</li>
                <li>Allocate time for working and time for resting.</li>
                <li>Make time for doing things you enjoy.
                </li>
