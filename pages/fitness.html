            <h2>Physical Fitness in COVID-19 Pandemic</h2>
            <img src="../assets/pexels-anna-shvets-4482936.jpg" alt="">
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic means that many of us are staying at home and sitting down more than we usually do.
                It’s hard for a lot of us to do the sort of exercise we normally do. It’s even harder for people who
                don’t usually do a lot of physical exercise.

                But at a time like this, it’s very important for people of all ages and abilities to be as active as
                possible. WHO’s Be Active campaign aims to help you do just that - and to have some fun at the same
                time.</p>

            <p>Remember - Just taking a short break from sitting, by doing 3-4 minutes of light intensity physical
                movement, such as walking or stretching, will help ease your muscles and improve blood circulation and
                muscle activity.</p>

            <p> Regular physical activity benefits both the body and mind. It can reduce high blood pressure, help
                manage weight and reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and various cancers - all
                conditions that can increase susceptibility to COVID-19.

                It also improves bone and muscle strength and increases balance, flexibility and fitness. For older
                people, activities that improve balance help to prevent falls and injuries.</p>

            <p> Regular physical activity can help give our days a routine and be a way to stay in contact with family
                and friends. It’s also good for our mental health - reducing the risk of depression, cognitive decline
                and delay the onset of dementia - and improve overall feelings</p>
