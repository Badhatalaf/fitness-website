            <h2>Diet in COVID-19 Pandemic</h2>
            <img src="../assets/pexels-trang-doan-1105166.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Eating a healthy diet is very important during the COVID-19 pandemic. What we eat and drink can affect
                our bodyâ€™s ability to prevent, fight and recover from infections.</p>

            <p> While no foods or dietary supplements can prevent or cure COVID-19 infection, healthy diets are
                important for supporting immune systems. Good nutrition can also reduce the likelihood of developing
                other health problems, including obesity, heart disease, diabetes and some types of cancer.</p>

            <p> For babies, a healthy diet means exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months, with the introduction
                of nutritious and safe foods to complement breastmilk from age 6 months to 2 years and beyond. For young
                children, a healthy and balanced diet is essential for growth and development. For older people, it can
                help to ensure healthier and more active lives.</p>

            <p>Tips for maintaining a healthy diet:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Eat a variety of food, including fruits and vegetables</li>
                <li>Cut back on salt</li>
