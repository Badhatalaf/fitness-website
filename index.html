                <h2>Fitness during COVID period</h2>
                <p>The COVID-19 pandemic means that many of us are staying at home and sitting down more than we usually
                    do. It’s hard for a lot of us to do the sort of exercise we normally do. It’s even harder for people
                    who don’t usually do a lot of physical exercise. Regular physical activity
                    can help give our days a routine and be a way to stay in contact with family and friends</p>

                <h2>Mental fitness during COVID period</h2>
                <p>The new realities of working from home, temporary unemployment, home-schooling of children.
                    Adapting to lifestyle changes such as these, and managing the fear of contracting the virus and
                    worry about people close to us who are particularly vulnerable, are challenging for all of us.</p>

                <h2>Diet in Quarantine</h2>
                <p>Due to the coronavirus, the government had kept lockdown everywhere in India, as in this case, it is
                    imperative to manage our diet. Being at home 24/7 is not easy, we have no work to do as compared to
                    our regular days; thus the only one thing which we repeatedly do is only eating and cooking of
                    different varieties of food. This predicament can affect our health.</p>
